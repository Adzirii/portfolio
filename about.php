        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Nikita Liubov, and I began my journey in computer science in 2020, when I enrolled in university in Yekaterinburg, Russia. Initially, I was passionate about game development and spent time working with Unity. Over the years, I expanded my knowledge in different areas of programming, and by 2021, I was teaching teenagers programming languages such as Scratch, Python, C#, and Java.</p>
        <p>From 2021 to 2022, I worked as a programming teacher, helping young students learn the fundamentals of coding and problem-solving. This experience helped solidify my own understanding of programming and gave me the opportunity to work with a variety of technologies and languages.</p>
        <p>Since July 2024, I’ve been working at TCS Hungary in Budapest, where I’m applying my skills in software development, particularly in Java. Although my focus is on Java, I’m also expanding my knowledge by exploring other technologies, such as PHP, as part of my university studies.</p>
